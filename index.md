# **About**

Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has recently made remarkable progress in solving complex tasks in several application domains, such as games, finance, autonomous driving, and recommendation systems. However, the black-box nature of deep neural networks and the complex interaction among various factors, such as the environment, reward policy, and state representation, raise challenges in understanding and interpreting DRL models' decision-making processes. To address these issues, the workshop aims to explore the intersection of DRL with another important research area in artificial intelligence: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). XAI has become a crucial topic, aiming to enhance the accountability, trustworthiness, and accessibility of autonomous systems.


The workshop aims to bring together researchers, practitioners, and experts from both communities (DRL and XAI) by primarily focusing on methods, techniques, and frameworks that enhance the explainability and interpretability of DRL algorithms. Additionally, we will work towards defining standardized metrics and protocols to evaluate the performance and transparency of autonomous systems.

## **Topics**

The topics include <u>but are not limited to</u>:
- Novel XAI methods (*post-hoc, ante-hoc*, model-agnostic, etc.);
- Interpretable/Explainable deep reinforcement learning models;
- XAI methods to extract learned strategies;
- How can we use explanations to improve DRL agents?
- XAI evaluation: how can we assess the quality of explanations and their effectiveness? 
- Analysis of limitations of current XAI approaches;
- Position papers on the topic of the workshop.

Note: XAI methods applied to deep reinforcement learning models will be prefered for the selection of contribution do be presented during the workshop. However, we also welcome XAI methods applied do deep learning or classica

- **Q: Can I attend the workshop without being registered for AAAI 2024 conference?** <br>
*A: The workshop is hosted by AAAI. Therefore, you have to be registered for the conference of AAAI 2024 in order to attend the talks and the poster session of our workshop.*

- **Q: Is there any additional cost associated with the acceptance of my paper?** <br>
*A: There are no additional costs associated with our workshop.*





# **Call for Papers**

The call for papers includes two different tracks: *short* and *regular* track.


## **Tracks**

### **Short track:**

### **Regular track:**
Submissions to this track have to be novel contributions covering any topic listed above. We don't accept work that has been already accepted or published to other venues before the submission deadline, or that is presented at the main AAAI conference, including as part of an invited talk. We solicit submission of full papers, position papers, and papers describing open problems on one of the topics listed above. Papers must be submitted through the open review system (LINK NOT AVAILABLE)). <u>Papers submitted to the workshop can be submitted to future conferences (e.g. ICML, ICLR) if the acceptance notification comes after the workshop date (February, 27)</u>. 

*We encourage the authors to link a **anonymized** repository containing the code to replicate the results inside the corpus of the paper.* While this is not a mandatory requirement, it will be positively taken in account during the reviewing process and the selection of the contributed talks. You can use <a href="https://anonymous.4open.science/">Anonymous Github</a> or you can upload your repository on a service that allows anonymity (e.g. GDrive allows anonymous links).

Submissions must be in an **anonymized paper format** following the same template of the AAAI track (see <a href="https://aaai.org/aaai-conference/submission-instructions/"> HERE</a>), and they are limited to a maximum of 7 pages, excluding references. They will undergo double-blind peer review. Authors may append to the paper supplementary material, such as appendices, proofs, and derivations; Like submissions, supplementary material must be anonymized. Looking at supplementary material is at the discretion of the reviewers.


Accepted works will be presented as contributed talks or as posters in a poster session depending on schedule constraints.
<u>It is mandatory that at least one of the authors will attend the workshop and present its work during the contributed talks and the poster session</u>. 



**Important Dates**

Submission system opens: 11:59 PM CET, Oct 15, 2023

Submission deadline: 11:59 PM CET, Nov 15, 2023 

Notification date:  11:59 PM CET, Dec 10, 2023
